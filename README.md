# Higher Level Hash Methods

##Objectives
* Use the `values` method to return the values in a hash
* Use the `keys` method to return the keys in a hash
* Use the `min` method to return the minimum value of hash

Let's learn some interesting methods we can call on hashes. Previously, you were asked to iterate over a hash and collect the key that pointed to the lowest value. We asked you not to use some of the higher level hash methods there. Now, we're going to learn a few tricks that can make a task like that much easier. 

### `.values`

You can collect all of the values in a hash with the `.values` method: 

```ruby
groceries = {fruit: "Banana", vegetable: "Broccoli", dessert: "Cookie"}

groceries.values
#  => ["Banana", "Broccoli", "Cookie"]
```

We can see that the `.values` method returns an array of the values of the keys in the hash. 

### `.keys`

This method, not surprisingly, returns an array containing all of the keys in the hash that `.keys` has been called on: 

```ruby
groceries = {fruit: "Banana", vegetable: "Broccoli", dessert: "Cookie"}

groceries.keys
#  => [:fruit, :vegetable, :dessert]
```

### `.min`

You can use the `.min` method on a hash to return the key/value *pair* that contains that **lowest** value. What return type can return two different things? Arrays!: 

```ruby
food_items = {apples: 45, pears: 12}

food_items.min
#  => [:apples, 45] 
```

These are only a few of the many helpful methods out there. Be sure to check out the [Ruby Docs on Hashes](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Hash.html) to learn more. 

Let's practice before you move on to the next challenge: 


## Code Along: Manipulating Nested Hashes

You'll be coding your solution to this challenge in `lib/values.rb`, `lib/keys.rb`, and `lib/min.rb`. We have a nested hash of grocery item.

```ruby
groceries = {
  dairy: ["milk", "yogurt", "cheese"],
  vegetable: ["carrots", "broccoli", "cucumbers"],
  meat: ["chicken", "steak", "salmon"],
  grains: ["rice", "pasta"]
}
```
 
## Challenge 1: Return the values
Use the `.values` method to collect all of the values of the grocery type keys (`:dairy`, `:vegetables`, `:meat`, `:grains`). The method should return a *one-dimensional* (or "flat") array that *only* includes the values (groceries such as "milk" and "carrots") without their keys. 

**Hint:** What happens when you call `.values` on a nested hash? What is the return value? How can you *flatten* an array of arrays? Make sure to use `binding.pry` to help you solve this one. 

```ruby
groceries.values
#=> [["milk", "yogurt", "cheese"], ["carrots", "broccoli", "cucumbers"], ["chicken", "steak", "salmon"], ["rice", "pasta"]]
```
Now, to get all the values in a flat array:

```ruby 
groceries.values.flatten
#=> ["milk", "yogurt", "cheese", "carrots", "broccoli", "cucumbers", "chicken", "steak", "salmon", "rice", "pasta"]
```

Check the return value of your method by running `ruby bin/values` in the terminal.

## Challenge 2: Return the keys
Use the `.keys` method to collect all of the keys of the hash. This one is simple enough.

```ruby 
groceries.keys
#=> [:dairy, :vegetable, :meat, :grains]
```

Check the return value of your method by running `ruby bin/keys` in the terminal.

## Challenge 3: Return the min
Use the `.min` method to collect the value that comes first alphabetically ("broccoli"). 

###Step 1. Grab all the grocery values
Lucky for us, we already did this is Challenge 1. If we call, `groceries.values.flatten` we should get back: `["milk", "yogurt", "cheese", "carrots", "broccoli", "cucumbers", "chicken", "steak", "salmon", "rice", "pasta"]`

###Step 2. Get the minimum value
Simply calling `.min` on what we did in Step 1 should do the trick: 

```ruby 
groceries.values.flatten.min
#=> "broccoli"
```

Check the return value of your method by running `ruby bin/min` in the terminal.

Note: `.min` will also work for the entire hash. Play around in pry to see what is returned when you call `groceries.min`.
